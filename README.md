## Task 1: Responsive Web Page with Vanilla JS

### Objective:
Create a single-page responsive website using HTML5, CSS3, and Vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks).

### Key Features:
- A **responsive navigation bar**.
- A **hero section** with a background image and text overlay.
- A grid of **four product cards** that rearrange based on screen size (using media queries).
- Mobile-first design with optimization for different screen sizes.

### Files:
- `index.html` - The HTML structure of the page.
- `styles.css` - CSS styles for responsiveness, using Flexbox and Grid.
- `main.js` - Vanilla JavaScript for simple interactivity (e.g., filtering or animations).

## Task 2: Recreate Design with React

### Objective:
Recreate the web page designed in Task 1 using **React.js**.

### Key Features:
- **Reusable components**: The design is broken down into reusable components like `NavBar`, `Hero`, and `Card`.
- Fully **responsive** layout with proper media query handling.
- Use of **state management** for interactive elements such as toggling modals or navigation drawers.

### Components:
- `NavBar.js`
- `Hero.js`
- `Card.js`
- `App.js`

### Libraries:
- **Tailwind CSS** or **Sass** for styling.
- **React Spring** or CSS transitions for simple animations or UI effects.

## Task 3: Product Filter with JavaScript & React

### Objective:
Implement a product filter feature using Vanilla JavaScript and React.js, fixing the issues in JavaScript logic and ensuring the product list updates dynamically when filters are applied.

### Features:
- Filtering by **category** and **price range**.
- In **Vanilla JavaScript**: A fully functional product filter feature with DOM manipulation.
- In **React**: Use of **React Hooks** (`useState`, `useEffect`) for managing filter state and dynamically updating the product list.

### Bonus Features:
- In React, the filter is updated automatically when any filter is changed (using `useEffect`), so no button click is required.
- The product list dynamically renders based on the applied filters.
